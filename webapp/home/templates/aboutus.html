    <ul layout-align="center center" style="justify-content:space-around;line-height:200%;align-self:center;margin-left:5cm;font-size:150%">
        <li>
            <p> Organise skill recruitment across all industry segments, especially focusing Indian ecosystem</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Finding right skill for a opening is too time consuming and frustrating</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Mutual issues in visibility of Career openings and Skilled people</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mutual Confidence deficit among Candidates, Career openings and employers</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Job matching is the beginning of a successful placement, for finding next successful candidate or career opening, current placement has to be tracked for outcome from perspective of both Candidate and Job provider</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Introducing a coordinator role in middle to facilitate placement, track placement status and follow up if there is a inactivity on either side (candidate, job provider)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Because coordinator is involved, we have to ensure coordinators effort is best utilized and scaled to large number of candidates and openings and keep the required number of coordinator minimal</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Language barriers have to be crossed, if Samarth needs to cover all industry segments, large number of skilled people, geographical locations and openings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Intuitive and forgiving user interface is needed as it is expected to be used by large number people with varied level of familiarity with computer interfaces</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>As coordinators are involved, there is a implicit middleman in the process of placement, which demands transparency among coordinators, among job providers and skilled people. Transparency has to be default nature of the app</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Standardising process of placement, verification, profile posting so that system capability is not diluted or compromised because of personal bias of people involved, human interferences</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>System aiding is needed in all the steps of the process so that manual efforts can be reduced and mistakes can be avoided to possible extent and constantly improved</p>
        </li>
